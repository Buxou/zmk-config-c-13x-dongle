ZMK firmware for the C-13x keyboard, for the wireless keyboard, the wireless keyboard with a dongle, and the wired keyboard.
Everything is also configured for graphical keyboard layout settings.
Sorry for my poor language skills; English isn't my native language.

The firmware is in the testing stage, because I donâ€™t have enough nice!nano v2 yet.

- board: nice_nano_v2:
  - shield: c-13x_dongle: not fully tested.
  - shield: c-13x_central: not fully tested.
  - shield: c-13x_peripheral: not tested.
  - shield: c-13x: not tested.

- board: adafruit_kb2040
  - shield: c-13x: check, work.
